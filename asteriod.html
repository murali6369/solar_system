            <p class="main-text">The Main Asteroid Belt is a vast region of space located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It's home to millions of rocky bodies, known as asteroids, which are believed to be remnants of a planet that never fully formed. The asteroids vary greatly in size and shape, and collisions between them are relatively rare due to the vast distances between them.<br><br>
            Despite the large number of asteroids, the Main Belt is actually quite sparsely populated. The average distance between asteroids is millions of kilometers. However, when collisions do occur, they can create smaller asteroids and debris.<br><br>
            Scientists continue to study the Main Asteroid Belt to learn more about the formation and evolution of our solar system. They are also interested in the potential for asteroid mining, as some asteroids may contain valuable resources.</p>

They are often found in stable regions known as Lagrange points. Jupiter has the largest population of Trojan asteroids, but other planets like Neptune and Mars also have them</p>
