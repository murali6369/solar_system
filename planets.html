                            Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English,
                            it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and
                            communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet,
                            with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.
                            The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have
                            accumulated over billions of years.
